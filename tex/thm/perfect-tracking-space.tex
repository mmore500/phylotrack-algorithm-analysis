\begin{theorem}{Naive Perfect Tracking Space Complexity}
\label{thm:perfect-tracking-space}
The space complexity of the naive perfect tracking algorithm is $\mathcal{\theta}(\sum_{t=0}^{G} N_t$), where $N_t$ is the number of new objects born at time $t$ and $G$ is the number of time steps.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\label{prf:perfect-tracking-space}
The birth-handling algorithm adds a node to the tree ($T$) each time it is called.
It is called once for every birth event.
No nodes are ever removed from $T$.
Therefore, the number of nodes in $T$ is the total number of nodes ever created.
\end{proof}
