\begin{theorem}{Naive Perfect Tracking Time Complexity}
\label{thm:perfect-tracking-time}
The naive perfect tracking algorithm can be implemented in constant time ($\mathcal{O}(1)$) per birth event.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\label{prf:perfect-tracking-time}
For the purposes of this proof, we use the RAM model of computation. 
Initialization takes a single simple operation and only happens once. 
Thus, it is trivially constant-time.
Handling a birth event takes two simple operations.
Thus, each run of the birth-handling algorithim trivially takes constant time.
The birth-handling algorithm will run once per birth event.
Although the number of birth events is likely not constant with respect to the size of the population or the number of generations,
these birth events are not part of the tracking algorithm and would have happened regardless of whether phylogeny tracking was in place.
Consequently, adding phylogeny tracking will only increase the time complexity of a computational process to which it is added by a constant amount per birth event.
\end{proof}
