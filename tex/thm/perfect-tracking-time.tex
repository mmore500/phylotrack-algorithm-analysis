\begin{theorem}{Naive Perfect Tracking Time Complexity}
\label{thm:perfect-tracking-time}
The naive perfect tracking algorithm can be implemented in constant time ($\mathcal{O}(1)$) per birth event.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\label{prf:perfect-tracking-time}
For the purposes of this proof, we use the RAM model of computation. 
Initialization takes a single simple operation and only happens once. 
Thus, it is trivially constant-time.
Handling a birth event takes two simple operations.
Thus, each run of the birth-handling algorithim trivially takes constant time.
The birth-handling algorithm will run once per birth event.
\end{proof}
